Project Name: MindArc
Tagline: Earn your screen time through meaningful effort


1. PURPOSE & VISION

Purpose:
MindArc is a digital wellbeing application designed to help students reduce excessive screen time by turning access to distracting apps into a reward that must be earned through positive physical or cognitive activities.

Vision:
To promote healthier digital habits by encouraging students to replace mindless scrolling with exercise and focused reading, while still giving them control and flexibility.


2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Students spend a large portion of their daily time on smartphones, especially on social media and entertainment apps. Existing screen-time control solutions depend heavily on self-discipline and can be easily ignored or bypassed. There is a need for a system that actively enforces discipline by linking screen access to productive behavior.


3. TARGET USERS

Primary Users:
- College students
- High school students
- Students struggling with screen addiction

Secondary Users:
- Users aiming to improve physical fitness
- Users trying to build reading and focus habits


4. GOALS & OBJECTIVES

- Reduce unnecessary screen usage
- Encourage short and frequent physical activity
- Promote consistent reading habits
- Make digital discipline engaging rather than restrictive
- Provide visible progress and motivation to users


5. CORE FEATURES

5.1 App Blocking & Control
- Users select specific apps to restrict (e.g., social media, video apps)
- Restricted apps cannot be accessed freely
- App access is only granted after completing an activity

5.2 Activity-Based Unlocking
MindArc enforces meaningful activities before unlocking restricted apps.
Supported activities:
- Physical activity (pushups)
- Cognitive activity (reading)

5.3 Reading Activity (Flexible Design)
When the reading activity is chosen, the app offers two options:

Option 1: App-Provided Reading
- The app provides a random short story or article
- A fixed reading time is enforced
- After reading, comprehension questions are shown
- Correct answers are required to earn points

Option 2: User-Provided Reading
- The user can choose their own book, PDF, or document
- Reading time is enforced
- After completion, reflection-based questions are asked
- Questions verify understanding rather than exact content

This design allows freedom while ensuring genuine engagement.

5.4 Unlock Rewards
- Completing an activity unlocks restricted apps for a limited duration
- Greater effort results in longer access
- After the unlock period ends, apps are blocked again

5.5 Points, Streaks & Motivation
- Users earn points for every completed activity
- Daily streaks encourage consistency
- Achievements reward long-term discipline

5.6 Analytics & Progress Tracking
- Tracks activities completed
- Tracks points earned and unlock sessions
- Shows daily and weekly progress
- Displays streaks and achievements


6. USER JOURNEY

1. User installs MindArc
2. User selects apps to restrict

9. ASSUMPTIONS & CONSTRAINTS

Assumptions:
- Users are willing to exchange effort for screen access
- Short activities are more sustainable than long sessions

Constraints:
- Requires special permissions for app monitoring
- Reading validation for external content is limited to reflection
- Activity accuracy may vary depending on environment


10. SUCCESS METRICS

- Reduction in daily screen unlock frequency
- Increase in completed activities per day
- Consistent maintenance of streaks
- Positive feedback from student users


11. RISKS & MITIGATION

Risk: Users try to bypass restrictions
Mitigation: Time-based enforcement and repeated activity requirement

Risk: Loss of user motivation
Mitigation: Gamification and visible progress tracking

Risk: Over-restriction
Mitigation: User-controlled app selection and activity choice


12. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

- Additional exercise options
- Personalized activity recommendations
- Smartwatch integration
- Social challenges and leaderboards
- Adaptive difficulty based on user behavior


13. SUMMARY
